# React Alert Toggle

A simple React + Tailwind example that demonstrates how to open and close an alert with smooth transitions, without pushing surrounding content.

## Features

- Button toggles an alert on/off.
- Alert is absolutely positioned, so it doesnâ€™t shift the layout.
- Smooth fade & slide transition using Tailwind CSS.
- Fully responsive.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pr-assignments/alert.git
cd alert
npm install
npm run dev
```
